## Research

Interested in special toric geometries, i.e. studying n-manifolds with holonomy being a proper subgroup of $$SO(n)$$ and an effective Hamiltonian torus action. Additionally, I am also interested in applications of differential geometry and symmetry in other fields, such as group invariant machine learning and continuous game theory.
